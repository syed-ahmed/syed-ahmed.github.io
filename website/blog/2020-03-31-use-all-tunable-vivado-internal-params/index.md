title: Use All Tunable Vivado Internal Params

So I learned about this parameter that can be set in vivado, called `place.debugShape`, for my overlay generation work. It was referred in one of the tcl scripts in RapidWright with the command `set_param place.debugShape $shapesFileName`. Studying the tcl commands guide, I found out, you can list the description of this property using `report_param -non_default`, which suggests `place.debugShape` is an internal knob. A caveat of the report_param command is that, it only lists these internal params when it is changed from its default value (you can know its default value by `get_param`). That is, `report_param -non_default` won't show you all the internal knobs that are in vivado. <!--truncate-->

Now that you have some context, it got me thinking are there other useful params which we should know about? Looks like somebody asked the same [question](https://forums.xilinx.com/t5/Vivado-TCL-Community/lt-list-param-gt-not-listing-a-lot/td-p/998194) in Xilinx's forum, but received a reply from Xilinx saying those are internal and thou shall not use it.
When using the `place.debugShape` in my scripts, I saw some outputs:

```
Shape builder is called from:
Stack:
/opt/Xilinx/Vivado/2018.3/lib/lnx64.o/librdi_place.so(HAPLPlacerShapeBuilder::buildShapes(HDPLNewShapeDB&, HSTPtrHashSet&, HDPLTask&, HAPLPlaceApi*, HDPLControlSetDB const*,
/opt/Xilinx/Vivado/2018.3/lib/lnx64.o/librdi_implflow.so(HAPLFFastFlow3::place(HAPLFFastFlowParam const&, HAPLFMigPblockInfo const*)+0x12cf) [0x7f51a8e7bb3f]
/opt/Xilinx/Vivado/2018.3/lib/lnx64.o/libtcl8.5.so(+0x334af) [0x7f51ccef74af]
```
which looked like a familiar pattern - a frontend (tcl) binding to a C++ backend. So I was like, ok, may be if I grep the object dump of one of these `.so`, I could get the params? That didn't work. But what did work was, when I treated the `.so` in grep as a text file and searched for a "something-dot-camelCase" pattern, and voila, everything was in plain sight:
```
place.debugCongestion
place.debugCrash
place.debugFFGroup
place.debugLightTimer
place.debugMacroInterleavingOptimization
place.debugShape
place.debugShapeAppend
place.debugWireLen
...
```
And many more such as:
```
logicopt.allowEmptyHierCellNets
logicopt.allowEmptyHierCells
logicopt.allowInverterPushing
logicopt.annotateModifiedPrims
logicopt.applyFinishingTouch
logicopt.applyLogicProp
logicopt.applyPostPwroptCleanup
logicopt.applyRestruct
...
```

Similarly, there are tuneable params that look like `synth.*`, `route.*`, `power.*`, `timing.*`. in their respective `librdi_*.so`. That's all for this post. May be if you have a use-case, where you wanted vivado to do something, but it's not visible, one of these parameters might come into use! Of course I get Xilinx's point about these being internal knobs ;).

FYI following is the command with regex I used:
```
grep -a -o -E '[a-zA-Z0-9]{3,}.[a-z]([a-z0-9][A-Z][A-Z0-9][a-z]|[A-Z0-9][a-z][a-z0-9][A-Z])[a-ZA-Z0-9]{3,}' /opt/Xilinx/Vivado/2018.3/lib/lnx64.o/librdi_place.so
```

You can find about 5000 of the params I scraped, in this repository: https://github.com/syed-ahmed/vivado-hacks
