# Notes

These are my notes as I work through all the technical books
I have in my collection. The notes are not structured and
it's just here for my reference. However, feel free to
use the "Edit this page" button to <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/creating-an-issue#creating-an-issue-from-code">open a github issue</a> if
you want to have a conversation on the subject and learn together!
