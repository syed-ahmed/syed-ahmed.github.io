If you wanted to generate block designs based on some input parameters, you would be using TCL. If you are developing on a headless server, you would have no other choice than to use TCL.\nTCL programming is not bad, however, I'm very used to Python as my scripting language of choice. If you wanted to generate a block design that was data driven (for instance, use the decisions made by a PyTorch ML model or a Google OR-Tools model), you would need to introduce Python into the picture because TCL doesn't have such packages.\nIf Python was a front-end for Vivado, our problem would have been solved!

You could use ",(0,r.kt)("a",{parentName:"p",href:"http://elmer.sourceforge.net/examples.html"},"elmer")," to call Python from TCL (for instance, fork into a python class, get values from it and feed it to your TCL command), but elmer doesn't work for Python3.
