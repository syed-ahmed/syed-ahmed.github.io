As my life is changing around a lot of different things,
I thought I wanna get into a habit of reflecting on the aspects of
my life every month, so that I get a full grip on my personal 
development. I want to grow and be the best version of myself around
the people I love. And hence, this attempt.

I am thinking, every month I'll set a theme and some goals and I'll 
try to achieve them and record them here. I'll try to be as honest
as possible. 

This month's theme would be recovery. I recently went through a break
up and I want to fix one of my problems surrounding the break up. One
core problem I have is **not communicating my thoughts and feelings
honestly**. For instance, if you say something that hurts me, I pretend that everything is fine, whereas it festers in my mind.

Some things I'll try this month to mitigate this problem are:
- I'll be more outspoken when it comes to my feelings. 
- I'll meditate.
- I'll exercise to the best of my ability.
- I'll engage myself in healthy conversations with people.
- I'll read a book and share a summary of what I learned from it.

I'll publish my progress on these activities next month.
