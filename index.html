      I was born in Dhaka, Bangladesh. A very sweet place, has very beautiful rains and 2-3 hour long traffic jams. I was there
      for the majority of my childhood and teenage years. In 2011, I moved to Kolkata, India to complete my Grade 11 and
      12. Life there was quite dynamic and the place turned out to be very enriching for my personal development. Kolkata
      gave me life long friends and bitter and sweet memories. After Kolkata, now I am in Rochester, USA striving to become
      a Computer Engineer at Rochester Institute of Technology.
      <br>
      <br> Academically, I love to investigate high performance computing, machine intelligence, digital logic design, and cryptography. 
      Sounds too nerdy? Here are some more things – I love singing, playing the guitar, piano, percussion,
      philosophy, poetry (middle eastern Sufi poets especially!), travelling, reflecting, sleeping, criticizing, eating,
      observing people’s face and a lot of other things that you can discover about me if we ever spend some time together.
